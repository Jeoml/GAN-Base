# PyTorch GAN for MNIST Image Generation

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) using the PyTorch deep learning library. The primary goal of this GAN is to learn to generate synthetic images that closely resemble the handwritten digits found in the MNIST dataset.

## Code Structure

The project is structured around two main neural network models:

*   **Discriminator:** This is a neural network responsible for classifying images as either real (from the MNIST dataset) or fake (generated by the Generator). It takes an image as input and outputs a single value between 0 and 1, representing the probability that the image is real.

*   **Generator:** This neural network is designed to generate new images from random noise. It takes a vector of random numbers (noise) as input and outputs an image. The goal of the Generator is to produce images that are realistic enough to fool the Discriminator.

The core of the training process is the **training loop**. In each iteration of the loop, the following steps occur in an adversarial manner:

1.  **Train the Discriminator:** The Discriminator is trained on both real images (labeled as real) and fake images generated by the current Generator (labeled as fake). The goal is to improve the Discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake images.
2.  **Train the Generator:** The Generator is trained to produce images that the Discriminator classifies as real. The goal is to improve the Generator's ability to create realistic images that can fool the Discriminator.

This adversarial training process continues for a specified number of epochs, with both the Discriminator and Generator improving over time in a competitive fashion.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1.  **Set up the Environment:**
    *   Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher is recommended).
    *   Install the necessary libraries using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install torch torchvision tensorboard
        ```
    *   If you have a CUDA-enabled GPU, PyTorch will automatically use it for faster training.

2.  **Run the Notebook:**
    *   You can run the code using a Jupyter Notebook environment (like JupyterLab or Google Colab).
    *   Execute the code cells sequentially from top to bottom.
    *   The training process will start, and you will see the loss values for the Discriminator and Generator printed for the first batch of each epoch.

3.  **View Results in TensorBoard:**
    *   TensorBoard is used to visualize the generated images and track the training progress.
    *   In a new code cell within your notebook environment, run the following magic commands:
        ```python
        %load_ext tensorboard
        %tensorboard --logdir=runs
        ```
    *   This will launch the TensorBoard interface, typically inline within the notebook or as a separate tab, allowing you to view the fake and real images and other potential metrics logged during training. The logs are saved in the `runs` directory created during training.
